# Authors First Manifesto (v0.1)

As an author I should be able to...

1. author content without being tied to a specific tool or platform. 
2. structure my content as the content wants to be structured, not for the convenience or arbitrariness of a specific tool. 
3. read and navigate my content in the same tool and in the same view I use to write and edit. I shouldn't have to switch views or tools or go through a publishing step. The view can be WYSIWYG or show lightweight markup, but the links must be live. Let me do this without a network connection.
4. use tools that cater to my needs, not theirs. Shift as much burden (complexity, cognitive load, tedious mechanical work) from authors (humans) to the tools (machines).
